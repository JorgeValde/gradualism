Chapter 1: Historial Orientation
===================================================

Pg. 23: In the U.S.: 1921, Emergency Tariff Act introduced high duties on wheat, corn, meat, wool and sugar as a palliative for the agricultural unrest brought on by depression. Followed by Fordney-McUmber Act of 1922, dashed all hopes of debtor countries being able to pay off debts through exports. Marked a return to protectionism of the pre-Underwood days. Ag. products enjoyed high duties and increased rates of protected chemicals and metalurgical industries as well as others that feared foreign competition. The president used the ability to adjust rates by 50 percent up or down: 32 times up and 5 down in the following eight years.

U.S. would not negotiate its tariffs, so MFN wasn't reciprocated. Pretty much killed MFN. By 1929, clear that more protectionism was coming, along with Depression. Smoot Hawley (1930), Britain abandons gold standard in 1931, gold standard collapses, devaluation of dollar. By 1933, trade at one-third of 1929 levels.

Cordell Hull's Reciprocal Trade Agreements program (1934) led to agreements with 20 countries, maintained unconditional MFN. But wasn't able to shift the world toward liberalism, in part b/c U.S. tariff was still at such a high level. In part b/c global politics were ugly.

Keynes was not in favor of the domestic economy being subject to external (i.e. international) forces. But barriers to trade were an obstacle to the functioning of the international monetary system. Spring 1943: White and Keynes published plans for the post-war financial collaboration, including the free working of a multilateral payments mechanism, which in turn required that commerical controls should not impede international adjustments. Washington felt that U.S. should play important role in re-establishing a freer trading world.

Richard N. Gardner, 'Sterling-Dollar Diplomacy,' Oxford, 1956 pp. 12-13, describing how Hull's views determined the attitudes of the post-war planners in the U.S.: "They considered that they United States, as the world's foremost economic power, should bear the primary responsibility for reconstructing a freely flowing system of international trade. Perhaps most important, they were prepared to devote a considerable amount of American wealth, influence, and energy toward achievement of that end. Such a conjunction of power and idealism in economic affairs was entirely unprecedented in American history."


Ch. 3: The Most-Favored Nation Clause
===================================================

### The Significance of the Clause in the General Agreement

"The only way for a contracting party to avoid most-favored-nation treatment is to walk out of Gatt. But this would mean that the contracting party would also lose all the other concessions negotiated, quite apart from the one it wishes to avoid. It is hardly possible to conceive any single obligation which would make a country give up all the negotiated advantages which make up the Gatt package deal. Before Gatt it was possible to renegotiate with just the one country with whom one had difficulties without touching one's rights and obligations with any other trading partner. This is an important new development and shows that the nultilateral character of the Agreement adds up in tariff concessions to more than just a sumo fbilateral concessions."

pg. 69: US Trade Expansion Act may be of interest. It permitted the elimination of duties on those items in which the trade between the E.E.C. and the U.S. exceeded 80%.
