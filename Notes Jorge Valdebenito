I finished the first course on Github, the basic interface is pretty clear. 
Now I'm creating this first file in your repository.
This should act as my journal.
I'm starting the second course call "Mastering GitHub", given that Code School was absorb by pluralsight, the order of the courses is a bit
messy, I supose this course is apropiate because it's looks at pulling request and the like, not too advance I presume. 

I've read the notes on dynamic programing you send me, I'm still unclear regarding Bellman's equations, but I get the way it works by
using differents time periods in order to predict the right policy action in the present.
